# Random Walker Setup

The following configurations are required for the Random Walker web application.

## Nginx

[Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, and a
generic TCP/UDP proxy server.

In order to dvelop a web application, we need two components. First of all, a
internet facing web server which handles request from external clients.
Secondly, an application server which communicates between the web server and
the application.

In this configuration, `Nginx` is used as the reverse proxy to handle external
request and process the request according to the type of the request. For
example, static files will be directly served (although not currently
implemented.), while request to generate new location will be forward to the
application.

### Installation
To install `Nginx`, follow the [installation
guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts).

### Configuration

We need to configure `Nginx` so that it knows how to redirect the requests.

The [configuration
files](https://github.com/mkao006/random_walker_webapp/blob/master/nginx/conf.d/random_walker.conf)
sits under the **nginx** directory. The server listen to the port `80` from the
allowed `server_name` then redirect the request to `Django`.


## PostGis

`PostGIS` is a spatial database extender for `PostgreSQL` object-relational
database.

### Installation

The installation of `PostGis` can be cumbersome. Please follow where ever
[Google](https://www.google.com/) takes you.


### Configuration
The [initialise
script](https://github.com/mkao006/random_walker_webapp/blob/master/postgis/init/random_walker_db.sh)
is under the **postgis** directory.

This configuration file creates the database required for the `Random Walker`
application. This is required as `Django` can not create the database, and it
has to be initialised before `Django` can make the migration.

## Random Walker

The `Random Walker` application requires many pieces of software. For a detailed
list please refer to the
[`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/mkao006/random_walker/blob/master/Dockerfile).

The required `python` libraries are listed in under the
[requirement.txt](https://github.com/mkao006/random_walker/blob/master/requirements.txt)

## Elastic Beanstalk

## Docker

## Dockerhub

Currently, the `Random Walker` image is private and requires authentication
provided in `.docker/config.json`. The file is also on AWS S3 private bucket.

The `.docker/config.json` is generated by running the `sudo docker login`
command.
