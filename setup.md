inside software containers.

### Installation

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker-engine
```

```
pip install docker-compose
```

Install the docker machine
```
curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.7.0-rc3/docker-machine-`uname -s`-`uname -m` >/usr/local/bin/docker-machine && \
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
```

If you have the [permissiong or curl
problem](https://forums.docker.com/t/permission-denied-when-trying-to-install-compose-on-ubuntu/1034/5),
then run the following.

```
sudo bash -c "curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.7.0-rc3/docker-machine-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-machine && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine"
```

## Dockerhub

Currently, the `Random Walker` image is private and requires authentication
provided in `.docker/config.json`. The file is also on AWS S3 private bucket.

The `.docker/config.json` is generated by running the `sudo docker login`
command.
